### What does the following code tell us about explicitly returning from proc's and lambda's? (once again probably not assessed on this, but good to know ;)


```ruby
def lambda_return
  puts "Before lambda call."
  lambda {return}.call
  puts "After lambda call."
end

def proc_return
  puts "Before proc call."
  proc {return}.call
  puts "After proc call."
end

lambda_return #=> "Before lambda call."
              #=> "After lambda call."

proc_return #=> "Before proc call."

```

A lambda allows you to return back to method execution if the `return` keyword is placed inside a `Proc`. A `Proc` will terminute execution if `return` is placed inside `Proc`.
