### What will be outputted if we add the follow code to the code above? Why?

```ruby

  block_method('turtle') { puts "This is a #{animal}."}

```

This will throw a `NameError` for an undefined local variable `animal`.

This is because we are trying to reference `animal` but it does not exist in the main (top level) scope.

Most likely, the programmer was intending to reference the argument that goes by the parameter name `animal` in the `block_method` method definition. However, the block we pass in does not have access to this variable because it is out of scope. In order to access `animal`, we must receive the variable from the `yield` statement (which we do, on line 2). What we are missing is defining the name of the *block* parameter on line 9. We can fix this code by changing line 9 to `block_method('turtle') {|animal| puts "This is a #{animal}."}`
