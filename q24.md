### What will the method call call_me output? Why?

```ruby
def call_me(some_code)
  some_code.call
end

name = "Robert"
chunk_of_code = Proc.new {puts "hi #{name}"}
name = "Griffin"

call_me(chunk_of_code)

```

This method will output `hi Griffin`.

The main reason we see `Griffin` rather than `Robert` is due to binding. Binding describes the way a proc stores its surrounding context and drags it to wherever it is invoked. 

So, we've initialized our `Proc` object on line 9. At this point in time, the `Proc` that `chunk_of_code` is pointing to is aware of the variable called `name`, but it doesn't care what object it is pointing to at the moment. On line 10, we then reassign the value of `name` to `"Griffin"` which still, does not affect the binding of the `Proc`.

When we invoke `call_me`, we pass in our `Proc` object which is invoked inside the method on line 5. This `Proc` outputs an interpolated string with the `name` variable referenced. The `Proc` has this `name` variable as part of its binding and finds that the value stored in it is `Griffin`. This is why we see `Griffin` rather than `Robert`.
