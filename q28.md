### Why does the following code raise an error?

```ruby
def some_method(block)
  block_given?
end

bl = { puts "hi" }

p some_method(bl)
```

This code throws a syntax error because line 8 is not a valid way to create a block. 

Ruby gets confused when it reaches line 8 because this is an incorrect way to create a block. In order to create a block, we must pass in the block during the method invocation. We need to remove line 8 and change it to:

```ruby
  p some_method { puts "hi" }
```

However, this may not be the intended solution. Suppose we want to store our closure. We can do so by using Procs or lambdas with the following solutions:

### Procs
```ruby
def some_method(block)
  block_given?
end

proc = Proc.new { puts "hi" }

p some_method(proc)

```

### Lambdas
```ruby
def some_method(block)
  block_given?
end

my_lambda = lambda { puts "hi" }

p some_method(my_lambda)

```

However, these closures are not the same as blocks, so the `block_given?` method will return `false` even if provided these closures.
