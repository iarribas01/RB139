### What will the method call call_me output? Why?

```ruby
def call_me(some_code)
  some_code.call
end

name = "Robert"

def name
  "Joe"
end

chunk_of_code = Proc.new {puts "hi #{name}"}

call_me(chunk_of_code)

```

This code prints `hi Robert`.

This has to due with `Proc` binding and how Ruby resolves names.

In particular, we've defined a local variable that goes by the name `name` as well as a method that goes by `name`. Calling the `Proc` object does not throw an error because we are referencing a variable called `name` that does exist. Because of the way Ruby resolves names, it searches for a local variable before it searches for a method. This is why we see `hi Robert` rather than `hi Joe`.


(suppose we wanted to run the `name` method instead, we would need to prepend the reference on line 14 a `self` to specify the method in `main`.)
