
### Why do we get a LocalJumpError when executing the below code? & How do we fix it so the output is hi? (2 possible ways)

```ruby
def some(block)
  yield
end

bloc = proc { p "hi" } # do not alter

some(bloc)
```

We get a `LocalJumpError` because `some` `yield`s to a block during method invocation and is invoked without being passed a block. We can fix this by removing the `block` parameter in the `some` method definition and prepending `&` when we're passing in the local variable `bloc` to the `some` method during method invocation.
