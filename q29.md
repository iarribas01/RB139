### Why does the following code output false?

```ruby
def some_method(block)
  block_given?
end

bloc = proc { puts "hi" }

p some_method(bloc)
```

The following output is false because we are not passing in a block to the method.

We initialize a new `Proc` object and assign the local variable `bloc` to it. We then pass this `Proc` object to the `some_method` method invocation as an argument. `some_method` takes this `Proc` object and does nothing with it. However, it runs the method `Kernel#block_given?` which returns `false` because a block was not provided to `some_method`. Rather, a `Proc` was provided to `some_method`. This result is then passed back to line 10 and is outputted to the console.
