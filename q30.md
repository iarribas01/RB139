### How do we fix the following code so the output is true? Explain

```ruby
def some_method(block)
  block_given? # we want this to return `true`
end

bloc = proc { puts "hi" } # do not alter this code

p some_method(bloc)
```

We can fix the code by passing in a block to `some_method`. Currently, we do not want to alter the variable reassignment on line 8. So if we want to work with a `Proc` object, we'll have to convert it to a block somehow. We can do this by prepending `&` when we pass in `bloc` as an argument to the `some_method` method invocation. This uses the unary operator `&` to convert the `Proc` that `bloc` is pointing to--to a block. However, this will throw an `ArgumentError` because we are no longer passing any arguments. Instead, we are passing in a block. To fix this, we will have to remove the parameter `block` in the `some_method` method definition.

Final changes will look like this:

```ruby
def some_method
  block_given? # we want this to return `true`
end

bloc = proc { puts "hi" } # do not alter this code

p some_method(&bloc)
```
