```ruby
def call_me(some_code)
  some_code.call
end

chunk_of_code = Proc.new {puts "hi #{name}"}
name = "Griffin"

call_me(chunk_of_code)
```

Unlike before, this code will throw a `NameError` for an undefined variable `name`. Even though it looks like we've initialized the variable on line 11, our `Proc` object's binding doesn't have any awareness of this local variable because it was initialized *after* the `Proc` object was created. So, when we try to reference the local variabl `name` within our `Proc`, Ruby fails to find this variable.
