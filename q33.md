### What does the following code tell us about lambda's? (probably not assessed on this but good to know)

```ruby
bloc = lambda { p "hi" }

bloc.class # => Proc
bloc.lambda? # => true

new_lam = Lambda.new { p "hi, lambda!" } # => NameError: uninitialized constant Lambda
```

The following tells us that lambdas are an instance of a `Proc` object and are initialized in their own way. We also know that lambdas are not part of a `Lambda` class and must be instantiated with the following syntax `lambda { # code }`
