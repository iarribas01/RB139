### What will #p output below? Why is this the case and what is this code demonstrating?

```ruby
def retained_array
  arr = []
  Proc.new do |el|
    arr << el
    arr
  end
end

arr = retained_array
arr.call('one')
arr.call('two')
p arr.call('three')

```

`p` will output the contents of the local variable `arr` which is `["one", "two", "three"]`.

`retained_array` is a method that initializes a local variable `arr` to an empty array. It then returns a `Proc` object that adds the passed in element to the local variable `arr`. This `Proc` memorizes this array because of the `Proc`'s binding.

When we get to line 12, we are initializing local variable `arr` equal to the `Proc` object returned from the `retained_array` method. When we run the next line, we are calling the `Proc` object and passing in `"one"`. If we remember from before, the `Proc` simply adds the argument to the end of the array from the method earlier. Now, the array is `["one"]`. We continue this process for `"two"` and `"three"` and print out the return value of the block, which is the `arr`, which is `["one", "two", "three"]`.
