### 21. What concept does the following code demonstrate?

```ruby
def time_it
  time_before = Time.now
  yield
  time_after= Time.now
  puts "It took #{time_after - time_before} seconds."
end

```

The code demonstrates "sandwich code", one of the many uses of blocks. The method `time_it` records the time before taking performing some code specified by the programmer invoking the method. Then runs whatever code was in the block passed into the `time_it` method. Then, the method records the time after and displays how much time the block took to execute. We used the `yield` keyword on line 6 to execute the block passed in.
