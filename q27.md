### Why does the following raise an error?

```ruby
def a_method(pro)
  pro.call
end

a = 'friend'
a_method(&a)
```

The following raises a `TypeError` because we are trying to convert a string to a block but we expect a `Proc` or a symbol.

When we prepend `&` to an argument, we are trying to convert the object to a block. However, we cannot convert a String to a block. We can only convert a `Proc` to a block or a symbol so that the `Symbol#to_proc` method can be called.
